  **Multiple layouts support**

  Neutron supports multiple layouts. You just need to add a layout property in your json file related to the partial and it will render in your template file.
}}
{{ render "atoms/text/headline" }}

<p>This is a clean layout version. In Neutron you're able to create many layout styles letting you decide the layout you want to use in your templates!</p>

{{# contentFor "css"}}
<!-- This block is instantiated in pattern page, but this element will be rendered wherever you decide by adding the **outputFor** helper. In this case the result is the header element. -->
<style>
	body {
		font-size: 18px;
	}
</style>
{{/contentFor}}
